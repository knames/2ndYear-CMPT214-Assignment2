This is the reference manual for my vcalc.cc program. It is currently in a
partial working state. It will compile without error without the TESTING flag.
Including the TESTING flag while running it will cause the TESTING methods to
run in the main function. Currently, the working tests are:
	- alloc_vec
	- extend_vec
	- scalar_plus
	- print_vec
	- dealloc_vec

The test functions assert that the Vector has not been set to NULL through
a function failing to run, and then asserts that the Elem pointers are 
expected values.

Halfway through the testing function I deallocate newVec, to assert that
the function is working, and then following that I recreate the recently 
deallocated newVec to continue for the stub tests. Once the actual methods
replace the stub ones, I can remove the recreation of newVec and move
dealloc_vec to the end of the test bed.

The program will halt when running the stub tests due to them not
being fully implemented.
